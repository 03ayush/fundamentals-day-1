greeting("Rachel","Brent");


// write a function called 'changeCounter' that accepts coins and returns total yen.


// Create a new function called minimum3() that accepts 3 numbers and logs the smallest one

minimum3(1, 2, 3);
minimum3(6, 5, 4);
minimum3(3, 1, 2);
minimum3(1, 1, 1);


// Declare a function called sum() that takes an array of numbers as an argument adds them.
// i.e. sum([1, 2, 3, 4]) should return 10.


sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]);

// Write a function that accepts a string and reverses it.



// Write a function accepts a six-digit number that reverses the number.
// (Hint, you will have to turn the integer into a string before you can reverse it.)

var longNum = 123456;



// Write a function that accepts the following array and separates the people into two teams.
// No names next to each other in the array should be on the same team.

// Write a function countTs() that takes a string as its only argument and returns
// a number that indicates how many uppercase “T” characters are in the string.
// HINT: Google charAt()


countTs("Tomo wants to visit Tsukigi market in Tokyo.");

// Write a function called countChars() that behaves like countTs(), except it takes a
