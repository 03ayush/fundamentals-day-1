## Objectives:
1. Write functions that include a conditional, a loop, and 2 variables
    * Predict the result of a JavaScript expression
    * Compare `console.log()` and `return` in JavaScript 
  
### Instructions

1. Start with the file `10_variables`. Type `node` in your console to access the node REPL.  Copy and paste the code snippets into the REPL.  Predict the results before pressing `enter`.
1. When you finish all the numbered files, create a tic-tac-toe game with JavaScript.  To play your game, open `index.html` in your browser.
